# Thesaurus-in-C
A C program to build a basic thesaurus, encompassing approximately 200 words. Each word includes various synonyms, antonyms, and a figure of speech stored within the 'word.txt' file. The program consists of approximately 8 functions. It offers users the ability to:

- Look up a specific word
- Explore words beginning with a given letter
- Discover a random "word of the day"
- View search history
- Add a new word
- Conduct pattern-based searches

The "Word of the day" feature randomly selects a number, displaying the corresponding word and its attributes found within 'word.txt'. The pattern-based search functionality enables users to search for words using prefixes and postfixes.

The search history feature saves all previously searched words into a 'history.txt' file. Additionally, the 'addWord' function facilitates the dynamic expansion of the thesaurus by allowing the addition of new words.
